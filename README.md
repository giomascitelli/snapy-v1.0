# snapy-v1.1

A simple snake game made with Python's pygame library now with sound effects and background music! 

At the moment as nostalgic as it can get. In the future, I plan to make some updates to add some new game modes so you can have the good old snaky snake (snapy, actually) but with a fun twist.
